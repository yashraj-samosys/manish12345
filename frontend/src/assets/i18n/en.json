By meeting referral agents, you get to know who they are and how they run their business. You can find out their values and specialities so they will be able to help out your clients and friends no matter the need. Not every person is the right fit and by meeting more referral agents you will be a better friends and agent by recommending people that are the right fit. The other advantage of meeting referral agents is that you can develop a bond with agents across all regions and work with them to help yourself in your profession by being able to ask questions, get ideas and help your network grow"

The other was so that agents could stay in contact and find their friends and referral partners easily. A little bit of paying it forward for the good luck and fortunate acquaintances that have come to us in the past. WE have been fortunate to do well and happy to help others do the same. There is a small cost to keep things going so those who do join in get a great value and make the system successful by their support. The system being supported by all those who join in will help pass it forward as the participation of the agents and building their network will help the system continue to be relevant and work well for everyone. We all hope you enjoy the use of the system and that you find good value for your business and staying in contact with your friends. You can reach out to us through the contact page at any time."
